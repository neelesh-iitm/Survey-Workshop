**1.1 Introduction: The Power and Pitfalls of Surveys in Research (5 mins)**

*   **1.1.1 The Ubiquity of Surveys:** Why surveys are a cornerstone of data collection across disciplines (social sciences, market research, health studies, program evaluation, etc.).
    *   *Use Case:* A public health researcher in Chennai wants to understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy factors within specific communities. A survey is chosen as the primary tool to gather standardized data from a large sample efficiently.
*   **1.1.2 The Goal: From Questions to Insights:** Emphasizing that the *quality* of survey design directly dictates the *reliability and validity* of the collected data and subsequent analysis (Garbage In, Garbage Out principle).
*   **1.1.3 Session Roadmap:** Overview of topics covered – defining objectives, question crafting, questionnaire structure, sampling basics, ethics, and a hands-on introduction to Google Forms.

**1.2 Laying the Groundwork: Defining Objectives and Target Population (10 mins)**

*   **1.2.1 The Starting Point: Clear Research Objectives:**
    *   Why objectives are paramount: They guide every decision in survey design (what to ask, who to ask, how to ask).
    *   Characteristics of good objectives: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound (SMART).
    *   Translating broad research questions into specific survey objectives.
    *   *Use Case:* A financial institution wants to launch a new mobile banking app feature.
        *   *Broad Question:* "Will customers like the new feature?"
        *   *Poor Survey Objective:* "Gather feedback on the app." (Too vague)
        *   *Strong Survey Objective:* "To measure the perceived usefulness and ease-of-use of the proposed 'budget tracking' feature among current mobile app users aged 25-40 within the next quarter." (Specific target, measurable concepts, relevant, time-bound).
*   **1.2.2 Identifying and Defining the Target Population:**
    *   Who do you want to generalize your findings to? Defining the group precisely.
    *   Importance of specifying inclusion/exclusion criteria.
    *   Considering practical accessibility of the population.
    *   *Use Case (cont.):* For the banking app feature, the target population is "Current customers of Bank XYZ who actively use the mobile banking app at least once a month and fall within the 25-40 age bracket." This excludes non-customers, inactive users, and those outside the target age group. Defining this clearly helps in later sampling stages.

**1.3 The Art and Science of Question Crafting (15 mins)**

*   **1.3.1 Core Principles for Effective Questions:**
    *   **Clarity & Simplicity:** Use language easily understood by the *target* population. Avoid jargon, technical terms, and complex sentence structures.
    *   **Single Focus:** Each question should address only *one* concept or issue (Avoid double-barreled questions).
        *   *Use Case (Double-Barreled):* *Poor:* "How satisfied are you with the course content and the instructor's teaching style?" *Better:* Split into two questions: 1. "How satisfied are you with the course content?" 2. "How satisfied are you with the instructor's teaching style?"
    *   **Neutrality & Objectivity:** Frame questions to avoid influencing the respondent's answer. Avoid leading or loaded language (Reference: AAPOR Best Practices).
        *   *Use Case (Leading):* *Poor:* "Don't you agree that the high cost of textbooks is a major problem for students?" *Better:* "To what extent do you agree or disagree that the cost of textbooks is a major problem for students?" (Provides balanced options).
        *   *Use Case (Loaded):* *Poor:* "Should the university waste money on expanding the already luxurious sports facilities?" *Better:* "To what extent do you support or oppose the proposed expansion of university sports facilities?"
*   **1.3.2 Choosing the Right Question Types:**
    *   **Closed-Ended Questions:**
        *   *Dichotomous:* Yes/No, Agree/Disagree.
        *   *Multiple Choice:* Single or multiple answers. Ensure options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (consider "Other: please specify" or "Not applicable").
        *   *Likert Scales:* Measure attitudes/opinions (e.g., Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree). Use balanced scales (equal positive/negative options) and decide on a neutral midpoint.
        *   *Rating Scales:* Numerical (e.g., 1-10) or semantic differential (e.g., Difficult ---- Easy). Clearly define scale anchors.
    *   **Open-Ended Questions:**
        *   Capture rich qualitative data, explanations, unexpected insights.
        *   Use sparingly – harder to analyze quantitatively, can increase respondent burden. Best for exploratory questions or follow-ups ("Why did you give that rating?").
    *   *Use Case:* A researcher studying remote work preferences might use:
        *   *Likert Scale:* "Rate your agreement: 'I am more productive working remotely.'" (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree).
        *   *Multiple Choice (Multiple Answer):* "Which of the following tools do you regularly use for remote collaboration? (Select all that apply)".
        *   *Open-Ended:* "What is the biggest challenge you face when working remotely?"

**1.4 Structuring the Questionnaire for Clarity and Flow (5 mins)**

*   **1.4.1 Logical Sequencing:**
    *   Start with simple, engaging, non-sensitive questions.
    *   Group related questions by topic.
    *   General questions before specific ones (avoid priming).
    *   Place sensitive or demographic questions (age, income, etc.) typically towards the end (build rapport first).
    *   Use transitions between sections.
    *   *Use Case:* A survey on dietary habits in Chennai. *Logical Flow:* 1. General questions about meal frequency. 2. Specific questions about types of food consumed (veg/non-veg, grains, fruits). 3. Questions about eating out habits. 4. Questions about awareness of healthy eating guidelines. 5. Demographic questions (age, location within Chennai, occupation).
*   **1.4.2 Importance of Clear Instructions:**
    *   Overall instructions: Purpose, estimated time, confidentiality/anonymity statement, contact information.
    *   Specific instructions for question types (e.g., "Select only one," "Select all that apply," "Rate on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 means...").

**1.5 Introduction to Sampling Concepts (Briefly) (5 mins)**

*   **1.5.1 Population vs. Sample:** Reinforce the distinction.
*   **1.5.2 Sampling Frame:** The list or map from which the sample is drawn (e.g., student enrollment list, telephone directory). Issues of coverage error.
*   **1.5.3 Basic Approaches (Conceptual Introduction):**
    *   *Probability Sampling (e.g., Simple Random Sampling):* Every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of selection. Allows for generalization to the population (with margins of error).
    *   *Non-Probability Sampling (e.g., Convenience Sampling, Snowball Sampling):* Selection is not random. Easier/cheaper but limits generalizability. Findings apply only to the sample studied.
    *   *Use Case:* To survey Chennai residents about public transport satisfaction:
        *   *Probability:* Randomly selecting households from an official address list. (Difficult but allows generalization).
        *   *Non-Probability (Convenience):* Surveying people at major bus terminals or metro stations during specific hours. (Easier, but sample may over-represent frequent commuters and miss others).
*   **1.5.4 Representativeness:** The goal is for the sample's characteristics to mirror the population's characteristics on key variables. Bias occurs when the sample is systematically different.

**1.6 Ethical Considerations in Survey Research (5 mins)**

*   **1.6.1 Informed Consent:** Participants must understand the survey's purpose, how data will be used, potential risks/benefits, voluntary nature of participation, and whom to contact with questions *before* agreeing to participate.
*   **1.6.2 Anonymity vs. Confidentiality:**
    *   *Anonymity:* Researcher cannot link responses to individual participants (e.g., no identifying information collected).
    *   *Confidentiality:* Researcher *can* link responses but promises not to disclose identities.
*   **1.6.3 Data Security and Privacy:** How will data be stored and protected? Compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, local institutional review board requirements).
*   **1.6.4 Minimizing Harm:** Avoid questions that could cause distress; ensure respect for participants.
*   *Use Case:* Implementing informed consent in Google Forms: Use a description section or the first question (required multiple choice "I agree to participate") to present consent information clearly before the survey questions begin.

**1.7 Hands-On Activity: Introduction to Google Forms (15 mins)**

*   **1.7.1 Interface Overview:** Creating a new form, title/description fields, question toolbar.
*   **1.7.2 Adding Core Question Types:** Demonstrating how to add:
    *   Multiple Choice (Single Answer)
    *   Checkboxes (Multiple Answers)
    *   Linear Scale (for Likert-type ratings)
    *   Paragraph (for Open-Ended text)
*   **1.7.3 Basic Configuration:**
    *   Making questions required.
    *   Adding descriptions or validation rules (e.g., ensuring numeric input).
*   **1.7.4 Organizing the Form:**
    *   Adding Sections (Page Breaks) for logical flow.
    *   *Brief Demo:* Skip Logic (Conditional Questions) - e.g., If answer to Q1 is "Yes", go to Section 2; if "No", go to Section 3.
*   **1.7.5 Settings & Customization:**
    *   Theme options (basic appearance).
    *   Settings Tab: Collect emails (or not - for anonymity), limit to 1 response, show progress bar, edit confirmation message.
*   **1.7.6 Distribution:** How to get the shareable link.
*   **1.7.7 Viewing Responses:** Quick look at the 'Responses' tab (Summary charts, Individual responses, Link to Google Sheets).
*   **Activity:** Participants draft 3-5 questions on a simple topic (e.g., workshop feedback, coffee preferences) using the demonstrated features. They share links and briefly fill out each other's forms to see the respondent experience and initial data aggregation.

**1.8 The Indispensable Step: Pilot Testing (Brief Mention) (Included in Takeaways)**

*   Why it's crucial: To identify confusing wording, technical glitches, estimate completion time, check skip logic.
*   Process: Test on a small group representative of the target audience *before* full launch. Gather feedback and revise.

**1.9 Conclusion and Key Takeaways (Recap) (5 mins)**

*   **Clarity is King:** Objectives, population definition, and question wording must be precise.
*   **Structure Matters:** Logical flow and clear instructions improve data quality.
*   **Question Design is Critical:** Avoid bias (leading, loaded questions), use appropriate types, ensure neutrality. (Reiterate AAPOR reference).
*   **Tools Facilitate, Principles Govern:** Google Forms simplifies mechanics, but sound design principles are the researcher's responsibility.
*   **Ethics are Non-Negotiable:** Prioritize informed consent and participant protection.
*   **Pilot, Pilot, Pilot:** Always test your survey before launching.
