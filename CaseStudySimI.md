Okay, Professor. Let's create a cohesive use case that spans all three sessions, using simulated data to illustrate the concepts.

**Use Case: Evaluating Student Satisfaction with University Library Services**

**Scenario:** "Chennai University" (fictional) wants to assess student satisfaction with its library services to identify areas for improvement and understand if needs differ between undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students.

---

**Session 1: Survey Design and Data Collection (Google Forms)**

1.  **Define Objectives & Target Population:**
    *   **Objectives:**
        *   Measure overall student satisfaction with library resources, staff, and facilities.
        *   Identify specific strengths and weaknesses in library services.
        *   Compare satisfaction levels between undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students.
        *   Gather qualitative suggestions for improvement.
    *   **Target Population:** All currently enrolled UG and PG students at Chennai University.

2.  **Survey Design & Question Formulation:**
    *   **Introduction:** State purpose (improve library), estimated time (5-7 mins), assure confidentiality/anonymity.
    *   **Section 1: Demographics**
        *   Q1: What is your student status? (Categorical: Undergraduate / Postgraduate)
        *   Q2: Which faculty/department are you primarily affiliated with? (Categorical: Engineering / Arts & Science / Business / Medicine / Other)
    *   **Section 2: Library Usage**
        *   Q3: How often do you typically use the university library resources (physical or online)? (Categorical: Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Rarely / Never)
    *   **Section 3: Satisfaction Ratings (Likert Scale: 1=Very Dissatisfied, 5=Very Satisfied)**
        *   Q4: Satisfaction with Book Collection availability. (Scale 1-5)
        *   Q5: Satisfaction with Online Journal/Database access. (Scale 1-5)
        *   Q6: Helpfulness of Library Staff. (Scale 1-5)
        *   Q7: Availability of suitable Study Spaces. (Scale 1-5)
        *   Q8: Comfort and Cleanliness of library facilities. (Scale 1-5)
        *   Q9: Overall Satisfaction with the University Library. (Scale 1-5)
    *   **Section 4: Open Feedback**
        *   Q10: Do you have any specific suggestions for how the library could improve its services or resources? (Open-ended text)
    *   **Quality Check:** Questions are single-focused (e.g., not asking about staff helpfulness *and* knowledge in one), use neutral language, and flow logically (demographics first, then usage, then detailed ratings, finally open feedback).

3.  **Tool Selection & Distribution:**
    *   **Google Forms** is chosen for ease of creation, distribution via university email/portal, and automatic response collection. Settings configured for anonymous responses.

4.  **Pilot Testing:**
    *   The draft survey is sent to 10 student volunteers (mix of UG/PG). Feedback indicates Q7 was slightly ambiguous; it's rephrased for clarity. Estimated completion time confirmed.

**Session 2: Statistical Analysis of Survey Data (Excel & Jamovi)**

1.  **Data Collection & Preparation:**
    *   The survey runs for two weeks, yielding 250 responses. Data is downloaded from Google Forms as a CSV file.
    *   **Simulated Data Snippet (`library_satisfaction.csv`):**

    | StudentID | Status | Department    | UsageFreq | Sat_Books | Sat_Journals | Sat_Staff | Sat_Space | Sat_Comfort | Sat_Overall | Feedback_Text                     |
    | :-------- | :----- | :------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :----------- | :-------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---------- | :-------------------------------- |
    | S101      | UG     | Engineering   | Weekly    | 4         | 3            | 5         | 3         | 4           | 4           | More power outlets needed         |
    | S102      | PG     | Arts & Science| Monthly   | 5         | 5            | 4         | 4         | 5           | 5           | Staff are very helpful!           |
    | S103      | UG     | Business      | Rarely    | 3         | 2            | 3         | 2         | 3           | 2           | Hard to find books sometimes      |
    | S104      | PG     | Engineering   | Weekly    | 4         | 4            | 4         | 5         | 4           | 4           | Quieter zones would be good       |
    | S105      | UG     | Arts & Science| Daily     | 5         | 4            | 5         | 4         | 4           | 5           |                                   |
    | S106      | PG     | Medicine      | Monthly   | 4         | 5            | 5         | 5         | 5           | 5           | Excellent online resources        |
    | ...       | ...    | ...           | ...       | ...       | ...          | ...       | ...       | ...         | ...         | ...                               |

    *   **Cleaning (Excel/Jamovi):** Open CSV. Check data types (Likert scales are numeric). Check for missing values (e.g., someone skipped Q8). Check categorical labels for consistency ('UG', 'PG').

2.  **Descriptive Statistics (Excel/Jamovi):**
    *   **Frequencies/Percentages:**
        *   Status: 150 UG (60%), 100 PG (40%).
        *   UsageFreq: Daily 10% (25), Weekly 40% (100), Monthly 30% (75), Rarely 15% (38), Never 5% (12).
    *   **Means/Medians/SDs (for Likert scales):**
        *   Sat_Overall: Mean=4.05, Median=4, SD=0.95
        *   Sat_Journals: Mean=3.70, Median=4, SD=1.10 (Potentially lower satisfaction here)
        *   Sat_Staff: Mean=4.30, Median=5, SD=0.80 (Staff seem well-regarded)

3.  **Basic Visualization (Excel/Jamovi):**
    *   Create a **Bar Chart** showing the distribution of `UsageFreq`.
    *   Create a **Bar Chart** comparing the Mean `Sat_Overall` for UG vs. PG students.

4.  **Basic Hypothesis Testing (Jamovi):**
    *   **Independent Samples T-test:** Compare `Sat_Overall` (dependent variable) between `Status` (grouping variable: UG vs. PG).
        *   *Hypothetical Result:* Jamovi shows Mean(UG)=3.85, Mean(PG)=4.35. The t-test p-value is 0.008.
    *   **Chi-Square Test:** Test for association between `Department` and `UsageFreq`.
        *   *Hypothetical Result:* Chi-square p-value is 0.04.

5.  **Interpretation:**
    *   Overall satisfaction is generally positive (Mean ~4.05).
    *   Staff helpfulness is a strength (Mean 4.30). Online journal access might be a relative weakness (Mean 3.70).
    *   Weekly usage is most common (40%).
    *   **PG students report significantly higher overall satisfaction than UG students (p=0.008).** This difference warrants further investigation.
    *   There is a statistically significant association between Department and Usage Frequency (p=0.04), suggesting usage patterns differ across faculties (needs closer look at the contingency table).

**Session 3: Advanced Data Analysis (Python & R)**

1.  **Need for Code & Reproducibility:**
    *   The library plans to run this survey annually to track changes. Manually repeating the Session 2 analysis each year is inefficient and prone to inconsistency.
    *   They also want to systematically analyze the hundreds of open-ended suggestions (Q10).

2.  **Automation & Reproducible Reporting (Python/R):**
    *   **Develop a Script (e.g., Python with Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn):**
        *   `import pandas as pd`
        *   `df = pd.read_csv('library_satisfaction_YEAR.csv')` # Read current year's data
        *   `# --- Data Cleaning Steps ---` (Apply consistent cleaning rules)
        *   `# --- Descriptive Stats ---`
        *   `print(df['Status'].value_counts(normalize=True))`
        *   `print(df.filter(like='Sat_').agg(['mean', 'median', 'std']))`
        *   `# --- UG vs PG Comparison ---`
        *   `ug_sat = df[df['Status'] == 'UG']['Sat_Overall']`
        *   `pg_sat = df[df['Status'] == 'PG']['Sat_Overall']`
        *   `from scipy.stats import ttest_ind`
        *   `t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(ug_sat, pg_sat, nan_policy='omit')`
        *   `print(f"T-test p-value for UG vs PG Overall Satisfaction: {p_value:.3f}")`
        *   `# --- Generate Standard Plots ---` (e.g., Bar chart of means by Status)
        *   `# (Code using matplotlib or seaborn)`
    *   **Benefit:** Run this single script each year with the new data file -> instant, consistent, reproducible core results.

3.  **Flexibility & Advanced Analysis (Python/R):**
    *   **Analyze Open-Ended Feedback (Q10):**
        *   Use NLP libraries (e.g., `NLTK` or `spaCy` in Python, `tidytext` in R) on the `Feedback_Text` column.
        *   **Tasks:**
            *   Tokenize text (split into words).
            *   Remove stop words ("the", "is", "a").
            *   Lemmatize words (reduce to root form).
            *   Calculate word frequencies to find common terms ("outlets", "quiet", "hours", "journals", "printing").
            *   (Advanced) Perform topic modeling (e.g., LDA) to automatically group suggestions into themes like "Facility Needs," "Resource Gaps," "Staff Compliments."
    *   **Benefit:** Provides quantitative insights from qualitative data, identifying key areas for improvement mentioned directly by students (e.g., "Need for more power outlets" was the most frequent suggestion theme).

4.  **Custom Visualization (Python/R):**
    *   Use `ggplot2` (R) or `seaborn` (Python) to create more sophisticated or customized plots for reports, perhaps showing satisfaction scores broken down by both Status *and* Department, or plotting satisfaction trends over multiple years once data accumulates.

**Conclusion of Use Case:**

This integrated approach demonstrates the progression:
*   **Session 1:** Carefully designing and deploying the survey using accessible tools like Google Forms lays the foundation.
*   **Session 2:** Basic analysis using Excel/Jamovi provides initial descriptive insights and allows for simple hypothesis testing, identifying key patterns like the UG/PG satisfaction gap.
*   **Session 3:** Using Python/R enables automation for ongoing tracking, ensures reproducibility, and unlocks advanced techniques like NLP to gain deeper insights from qualitative data, ultimately providing a more comprehensive and actionable understanding of library service satisfaction.
