## Exercise Structure

### Phase 1: Text Preparation and Exploration (15 minutes)

Participants will:
1. Review the dataset of open-ended survey responses
2. Clean and prepare the text data (remove irrelevant characters, standardize formatting)
3. Conduct initial exploration (word frequency, response length, common phrases)
4. Identify potential themes or topics for further analysis

### Phase 2: Theme Identification and Coding (20 minutes)

Participants will:
1. Select a text analytics approach (manual coding, word spotting, or using a tool)
2. Identify and define key themes in the responses
3. Code a sample of responses according to these themes
4. Compare manual coding with automated approaches
5. Refine the coding scheme based on initial results

### Phase 3: Sentiment Analysis (15 minutes)

Participants will:
1. Analyze the sentiment of responses (positive, negative, neutral)
2. Identify emotional indicators in the text
3. Compare overall sentiment with specific themes
4. Discuss the limitations of sentiment analysis

### Phase 4: Presentation and Discussion (10 minutes)

Participants will:
1. Present their findings to the larger group
2. Compare different approaches and results
3. Discuss challenges encountered and how they were addressed
4. Suggest how the insights could inform decision-making

## Sample Dataset

The exercise will use a dataset of 100 open-ended responses to the question: "What aspects of our product/service could be improved?" from a customer satisfaction survey. The dataset includes responses from different customer segments and varying levels of satisfaction.
