## Exercise Structure

### Phase 1: Planning and Design (15 minutes)

Participants will:
1. Review the survey dataset and identify key findings to visualize
2. Determine the main message or story they want to communicate
3. Select appropriate visualization types for different data elements
4. Sketch rough drafts of their visualizations and dashboard layout
5. Consider the target audience and purpose of the visualization

### Phase 2: Creation (25 minutes)

Participants will:
1. Use available visualization tools to create 3-5 different visualizations
2. Develop a cohesive dashboard that integrates multiple visualizations
3. Apply visualization best practices (color, labeling, scale, interactivity)
4. Create a brief narrative to accompany the dashboard
5. Ensure visualizations accurately represent the data

### Phase 3: Presentation and Critique (20 minutes)

Participants will:
1. Present their visualizations to the larger group
2. Explain the rationale behind their design choices
3. Demonstrate any interactive elements
4. Receive constructive feedback from other participants
5. Discuss how they would improve their visualizations

## Sample Dataset

The exercise will use a comprehensive customer satisfaction survey dataset that includes:
- Overall satisfaction ratings (1-10 scale)
- Product feature ratings (1-5 scale)
- Service quality ratings (1-5 scale)
- Customer demographics (age, gender, location, etc.)
- Purchase history information (frequency, recency, etc.)
- Open-ended comments (already coded into themes)

## Visualization Best Practices Reference

### Chart Selection Guide

| Data Relationship | Recommended Chart Types |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Comparison | Bar charts, Bullet charts, Radar charts |
| Distribution | Histograms, Box plots, Density plots |
| Composition | Pie charts (few categories), Stacked bar charts, Treemaps |
| Trend over time | Line charts, Area charts, Slope charts |
| Correlation | Scatter plots, Bubble charts, Heat maps |
| Geospatial | Maps, Choropleth maps, Cartograms |
| Part-to-whole | Pie charts, Stacked bar charts, Waterfall charts |
| Ranking | Ordered bar charts, Dot plots, Bump charts |

### Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Eliminate chart junk and unnecessary elements
2. **Accuracy**: Ensure scales and proportions accurately represent the data
3. **Clarity**: Use clear labels, titles, and legends
4. **Color**: Use color purposefully and consider accessibility
5. **Context**: Provide enough information to interpret the visualization
6. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent styles across related visualizations
7. **Focus**: Highlight the most important insights
8. **Interactivity**: Add purposeful interactive elements that enhance understanding

### Dashboard Design Tips

1. **Logical flow**: Arrange visualizations in a logical sequence
2. **Hierarchy**: Make the most important information most prominent
3. **White space**: Use adequate spacing to prevent cluttered appearance
4. **Filtering**: Include interactive filters for exploration
5. **Consistency**: Use consistent formatting throughout
6. **Mobile-friendly**: Consider how dashboard will appear on different devices
7. **Performance**: Ensure dashboard loads and responds quickly

## Debrief Discussion Questions

1. How did your visualization choices enhance or change the story told by the data?
2. What was most challenging about translating survey findings into visual form?
3. Which visualization techniques were most effective for communicating survey results?
4. How might different audiences influence your visualization choices?
5. What additional data would have made your visualizations more compelling?
6. How could these visualizations be used to drive decision-making?
7. What did you learn about effective data visualization from this exercise?

## Tips for Facilitator

- Emphasize that the goal is effective communication, not artistic perfection
- Encourage participants to consider their audience when designing visualizations
- Remind participants that different visualization types serve different purposes
- Highlight the importance of ethical data visualization that doesn't mislead
- If participants struggle with software, suggest focusing on the concepts and sketching by hand
- Connect visualization choices back to the survey data characteristics

## Extension Activities (if time permits)

1. **Executive Summary**: Create a one-page visual executive summary of key survey findings
2. **Alternative Perspectives**: Visualize the same data in two different ways to tell different stories
3. **Presentation Script**: Develop a short presentation script to accompany the visualizations
4. **Interactive Prototype**: Add more advanced interactive elements to the dashboard
5. **Peer Improvement**: Have groups exchange visualizations and implement improvements
