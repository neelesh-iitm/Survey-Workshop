# Interactive Exercise: Survey Administration Simulation

## Overview
This role-playing exercise simulates the entire survey administration process from planning to data collection. Participants will experience real-world challenges in survey distribution and learn practical strategies to maximize response rates and data quality.

## Duration
45 minutes

## Materials Needed
- Survey administration scenario cards
- Response rate challenge cards
- Survey distribution planning worksheets
- Role cards (survey administrator, respondent, stakeholder)
- Mock survey platform interface (printed screenshots)
- Timer

## Group Size
Groups of 4-6 participants

## Instructions for Facilitator

1. Divide participants into groups of 4-6 people.
2. Assign roles within each group:
   - 1-2 Survey Administrators
   - 2-3 Respondents
   - 1 Stakeholder
3. Distribute scenario cards to each group and role-specific instructions to each participant.
4. Explain the exercise flow:
   - Phase 1 (15 min): Survey administrators plan their distribution strategy
   - Phase 2 (15 min): Simulation of survey distribution and collection
   - Phase 3 (10 min): Debrief and lessons learned
5. During Phase 2, introduce "challenge cards" that present unexpected obstacles.
6. Conclude with a full-group discussion about effective strategies and lessons learned.

## Scenario Cards

### Scenario 1: Employee Engagement Survey
**Organization**: Regional hospital system
**Goal**: Measure employee engagement and identify improvement areas
**Target Audience**: 500 healthcare workers across 3 locations (doctors, nurses, administrative staff)
**Challenges**:
- Staff work different shifts (24/7 operation)
- Limited computer access for some roles
- Survey fatigue from previous poorly executed surveys
- Time constraints due to busy work environment

### Scenario 2: Customer Satisfaction Survey
**Organization**: E-commerce retailer
**Goal**: Gather feedback on recent online shopping experiences
**Target Audience**: 1,000 customers who made purchases in the last 30 days
**Challenges**:
- Diverse customer demographics (age, technical proficiency)
- Competition for attention in crowded email inboxes
- Need for quick turnaround of results (7 days)
- Previous low response rates (under 10%)

### Scenario 3: Community Feedback Survey
**Organization**: Local government
**Goal**: Collect input on proposed park renovation project
**Target Audience**: Residents in surrounding neighborhoods
**Challenges**:
- Digital divide (not all residents have internet access)
- Language barriers (area has significant non-English speaking population)
- Potential controversy about project details
- Need for representative sample across demographics

## Role Cards

### Survey Administrator
**Your Role**: Design and implement the survey distribution strategy
**Your Tasks**:
- Create a distribution plan using the worksheet
- Determine timing, channels, and messaging
- Develop strategies to overcome identified challenges
- Implement the plan during the simulation
- Adapt to unexpected challenges
- Track response rates and adjust strategy as needed

### Respondent
**Your Role**: Represent potential survey participants
**Your Tasks**:
- Review the respondent profile card you've been given
- React authentically to survey invitations based on your profile
- Provide feedback on what would make you more likely to respond
- Share obstacles that prevent you from completing the survey
- Explain what messaging or incentives would motivate you

### Stakeholder
**Your Role**: Represent the organization's leadership or client
**Your Tasks**:
- Communicate organizational priorities and constraints
- Provide additional context when needed
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the distribution strategy
- Ask challenging questions about response rates and representation
- Assess whether the survey results will meet organizational needs

## Respondent Profile Cards

### Profile 1: Busy Professional
- Limited time available
- Checks email primarily on mobile device
- Will only complete short surveys (under 5 minutes)
- Responds to clear value proposition ("How this helps you")

### Profile 2: Engaged Community Member
- Interested in providing feedback
- Prefers detailed explanation of purpose
- Concerned about privacy and data usage
- Willing to complete longer surveys if topic is important

### Profile 3: Reluctant Participant
- Survey fatigue from too many requests
- Skeptical about whether feedback will be used
- Requires incentive to participate
- May abandon survey if too complex or lengthy

### Profile 4: Limited Access Participant
- Limited internet access or technical proficiency
- Prefers non-digital survey options
- May need assistance with survey completion
- Values personal outreach and explanation

## Challenge Cards

1. **Email Delivery Issue**: 30% of your email invitations are being filtered as spam.
2. **Technical Glitch**: The survey platform is experiencing intermittent errors.
3. **Competing Priority**: A major organizational announcement has diverted attention.
4. **Demographic Gap**: Initial responses show underrepresentation of key groups.
5. **Stakeholder Pressure**: Leadership requests preliminary results earlier than planned.
6. **Negative Feedback**: Some respondents are complaining about survey length/complexity.
7. **Low Initial Response**: First-day response rate is only 2%.
8. **Survey Sharing**: The survey link is being shared with people outside the target audience.
