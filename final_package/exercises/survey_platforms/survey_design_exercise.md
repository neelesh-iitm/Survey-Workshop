## Question Type Reference Guide

### Closed-Ended Question Types

1. **Multiple Choice (Single Answer)**
   - Use when: Only one answer is applicable
   - Example: "Which department do you work in?"
   - Best practices: Mutually exclusive options, consider "Other" option

2. **Multiple Choice (Multiple Answers)**
   - Use when: Multiple selections are valid
   - Example: "Which features do you use regularly? (Select all that apply)"
   - Best practices: Clearly indicate multiple selection is allowed

3. **Likert Scale**
   - Use when: Measuring attitudes or opinions
   - Example: "Rate your agreement: The product is easy to use"
   - Best practices: 5 or 7 points, labeled endpoints, consistent direction

4. **Rating Scale**
   - Use when: Evaluating quality or satisfaction
   - Example: "Rate your satisfaction from 1-10"
   - Best practices: Clearly labeled scale points, consistent direction

5. **Ranking**
   - Use when: Determining preferences or priorities
   - Example: "Rank these features from most to least important"
   - Best practices: Limit items to 7 or fewer, clear instructions

6. **Yes/No**
   - Use when: Binary responses are appropriate
   - Example: "Have you used our mobile app?"
   - Best practices: Ensure question truly has binary answer

7. **Matrix/Grid**
   - Use when: Asking same question about multiple items
   - Example: Rating satisfaction with different aspects of service
   - Best practices: Limit rows and columns, consider mobile users

### Open-Ended Question Types

1. **Short Text**
   - Use when: Brief specific information is needed
   - Example: "What is your job title?"
   - Best practices: Clear about expected length

2. **Long Text**
   - Use when: Detailed feedback or explanations are needed
   - Example: "What improvements would you suggest?"
   - Best practices: Optional, placed later in survey

## Common Pitfalls Checklist

- [ ] **Double-barreled questions** - Asking about two things in one question
  - Example: "How satisfied are you with the price and quality?"
  - Fix: Split into separate questions

- [ ] **Leading questions** - Suggesting a "correct" answer
  - Example: "Don't you agree that our excellent service deserves 5 stars?"
  - Fix: "How would you rate our service?"

- [ ] **Loaded questions** - Containing assumptions
  - Example: "How much did you enjoy the event?" (assumes they enjoyed it)
  - Fix: "Did you enjoy the event? If so, how much?"

- [ ] **Ambiguous terms** - Using unclear language
  - Example: "Do you visit our website regularly?"
  - Fix: "How often do you visit our website? Daily, weekly, monthly, less often, never"

- [ ] **Technical jargon** - Using specialized terminology
  - Example: "Rate the UX of our SaaS platform's UI"
  - Fix: "Rate how easy our software is to use"

- [ ] **Unbalanced scales** - More positive than negative options
  - Example: "Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair"
  - Fix: "Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Very Poor"
