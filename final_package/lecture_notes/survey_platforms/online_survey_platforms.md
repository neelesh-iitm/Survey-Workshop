## 2. Survey Design Best Practices

### 2.1 Planning Your Survey

#### Setting Clear Objectives
Before creating any survey, establish:
- The specific information you need to collect
- How the data will be used
- Key decisions that will be made based on results

#### Understanding Your Audience
Consider:
- Demographics and characteristics of respondents
- Their familiarity with the subject matter
- Potential barriers to participation
- Appropriate language and terminology

#### Determining Data Types
Decide whether you need:
- **Quantitative data**: Numerical, measurable information
- **Qualitative data**: Descriptive, subjective information
- A combination of both

### 2.2 Question Development

#### Question Types
- **Closed-ended questions**:
  - Multiple choice (single answer)
  - Multiple choice (multiple answers)
  - Rating scales (Likert, numeric, etc.)
  - Ranking questions
  - Matrix/grid questions
  - Dropdown menus
  - Yes/No questions

- **Open-ended questions**:
  - Short text responses
  - Long text/essay responses
  - Comment boxes

#### Question Writing Guidelines

1. **Keep questions clear and concise**
   - Use simple, direct language
   - Avoid jargon, technical terms, and acronyms
   - Keep questions under 20 words when possible

2. **Avoid biased language**
   - Eliminate leading questions that suggest a "correct" answer
   - Remove loaded terms that evoke emotional responses
   - Present balanced response options

3. **Ask one thing at a time**
   - Avoid double-barreled questions that ask about multiple concepts
   - Example of what NOT to do: "How satisfied are you with the price and quality of our product?"

4. **Use appropriate response options**
   - Ensure options are mutually exclusive (don't overlap)
   - Make options exhaustive (cover all possible answers)
   - Include "Not applicable" or "Don't know" options when appropriate

5. **Consider question order**
   - Start with engaging, easy-to-answer questions
   - Group related questions together
   - Place demographic questions at the end
   - Be aware of order bias and how earlier questions may influence later responses

### 2.3 Survey Structure and Flow

#### Optimal Survey Length
- Aim for completion times under 10 minutes
- Limit to 10-15 questions when possible
- Consider using progress indicators

#### Logical Organization
- Group related questions into sections
- Use page breaks to create a clear structure
- Include clear section headings and instructions

#### Branching and Skip Logic
- Use conditional logic to show relevant questions based on previous answers
- Skip unnecessary questions to reduce respondent burden
- Create personalized paths through the survey

### 2.4 Design and Formatting

#### Visual Design
- Maintain consistent branding and styling
- Use white space effectively
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Keep the design clean and uncluttered

#### Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure compatibility with screen readers
- Use sufficient color contrast
- Provide alternative text for images
- Allow keyboard navigation

## 3. Survey Administration Techniques
